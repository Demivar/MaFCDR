Basics
------
Units are the primary unit of organization between you and your soldiers, allowing you to set orders and manage hundreds of individuals soldiers at once. Each unit under your command will have it's own supply source, battle strategy, tactics, name, and deployment settings, allowing you as their leader to maximize their use on the field.

Supplies
--------
Gone are the days of First Ones telling the mortals to steal from the locals in order to feed themselves--apparently, even at the behest of a First One they weren't too happy about it--now this is handled entirely under "supply". Supply is either drawn from a settlement under your command, or the settlement of the Unit's origin (TODO). Presently, this is strictly for food, but once a proper method to delay arrival of goods is added, this will also allow field resupply of armor, weapons, and other gear.

Strategy & Tactics (TODO)
------------------
Past Supplies, there are two main things you'll concern yourself with in regards to Units: Strategy and Tactics.

**Strategy** is your unit's course of action when in battle. Specifically, where it will try to orient itself in relation to opposing forces, and from which direction it will attack them. Each strategy is detailed below:

* Charge enemy - The Unit will always seek to be in range of enemy Units, moving direclty towards the nearest enemy if one isn't in range. If they are in range, they'll stay where they are. Best for regular infantry and cavalry. This is the default, if none is set.
* Hold position - The Unit will stay in it's current position, where it originally deployed. Unless morale breaks (perhaps from watching their allies get slaughtered), it won't move, even if engaged. Best for mixed forces (infantry + archers, for instance).
* Avoid enemies - The Unit will seek to distance itself from any nearby melees or enemy Units until all non-routed units on it's side only have "Avoid enemeis" as their strategy. At that point they'll begin retreating. If all units on a side are set to "Avoid enemies", the attacking side will default to "Charge enemy", while defenders will swap to "Hold Position", in order to prevent griefing.

**Tactics**, on the other hand, is how they will engage the enemy. Will they use ranged weapons? Melee? Or whatever is appropriate? The game will default to "Use Best" if not otherwise declared.

Line Settings & Fortifications
------------------------------
Simply put, these control where your forces deploy in relation to their allies and enemies and whether or not they'll leave fortifications to attack an enemy. They let you fine tune your forces time to encounter as well as make effective use of walls (which give a handy bonus to defenders).

Militia versus Professional
---------------------------
Lastly, while not yet a configurable options, you'll be able to define a unit as militia or not. 

Militia units will contribute to their home settlement's economy while there and will be able to bolster their numbers significanlty faster. Their training may include some basic weapon usage, but in times of emergency (like when under siege) it may just be giving them whatever weapons are available and hoping for the best. Lastly, they take penalties when going too far afield. You can march them across the continent, but it's not what they "signed up for".

Professional Units will trade that off for a passive experience gain and combat effectiveness bonus, being more likely to hold together in combat, and less likely to retreat when a fellow unit breaks or a First One falls in combat on their side. Their bonuses bolster both attack and defense, as well as maintaining morale and resisting opportunities to break and run. They're also the only forces capable of operating siege equipment afield.
